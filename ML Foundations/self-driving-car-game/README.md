# Self Driving Car Game
This project implements a neural network from scratch with a genetic algorithm to train a self-driving car. The car uses ray casting to detect distance from other cars and the sides of the road, and passes this info into a neural net with one input node per ray. These pass through a hidden layer to 4 output nodes, each encoding acceleration in a cardinal direction. 



The above features and visualizations were implemented following videos 1-10 from the YouTube playlist at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB0Tybl0UNfYoJE7ZwsBQoDIG4YN9ptyY.

I then added my own code to expand the project into a game for 1-2 players to play against the AI and/or each other. This was also my first time deploying a project online, which you can find [here]().
