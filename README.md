# Computational Biology & ML Portfolio

Welcome! This repository is a collection of my projects in machine learning and computational biology, built to structure and track my learning. I code all the projects in this repository by hand to practice the technical concepts I learn, using AI only for research and debugging non-logic issues.

# Project Summaries

ML Foundations
| Project | Description | Techniques | Date Completed |
|---------|-------------|------------|------------|
| [Self-Driving Car Game](https://github.com/sguru18/Comp-Bio-ML-Portfolio/tree/main/ML%20Foundations/self-driving-car-game) | A game for 1-2 players to race through traffic against a pre-trained self-driving car (neural net) | Neural networks, Genetic algorithms, Model training | 04/2024 |
| [Neural Net From Scratch](https://github.com/sguru18/Comp-Bio-ML-Portfolio/tree/main/ML%20Foundations/neural-net-from-scratch) | A minimal neural net built to practice the mathematics of backpropagation and gradient descent | ReLU, Backpropagation, Gradient descent | 08/2024 |
| [Computer Vision-Upgraded Self-Driving Car Game](https://github.com/sguru18/Comp-Bio-ML-Portfolio/tree/main/ML%20Foundations/cv-upgraded-self-driving-car-game) | V2 of the self-driving car game, upgraded so players can now steer their car by moving their fists. | Hand tracking, landmark extraction | 12/2025 |

# Timeline

The earliest projects in this collection are from spring and summer 2024, around my senior year of high school when I began learning about ML. After this, I did a lot of SWE projects using mainly React/React Native, Next.js, and Supabase/Firebase including [mathcentral.org](https://mathcentral.org) for my brother's middle school MathCounts team and [Destination Aurora](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/destination-aurora/id6633411101) for APS Data Technologies.

After taking a gap semester during Fall 2025, my interests returned to machine learning and computational biology specifically, from which point the other projects in this collection begin.

# About Me

My name is Srihari Gurugubelli, and I am a sophomore at UIUC majoring in CS & Bioengineering with a minor in Math. My background involves surviving cancer at 19, which guides my long term goal of working on ML systems that help make data-driven healthcare a fuller reality. Feel free to reach out at shguru110@gmail.com.
