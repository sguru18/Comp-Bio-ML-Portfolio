# Comp Bio & ML Portfolio
Welcome! This repository is a collection of my projects in machine learning and computational biology, built to structure and track my learning. I code all the projects in this repository by hand, without any AI, to practice the technical concepts I learn.

# About Me
My name is Srihari Gurugubelli and I am a Computer Science & Bioengineering major at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. My background involves surviving cancer at 19, which guides my long term goal of working on ML systems that help make data-driven healthcare a fuller reality.
